test_register_branch

### 2. what is the progress so far (at least some test cases written, more than 2)

wrote all test cases for R1-1 through R1-10 from sprint two. used output testing, input partition testing, and input boundary testing.

### 3. any difficulties.

ran into issue where tests were not verifying due to an issue with \r at the end of lines.
Also ran into issue where some tests are unintuitive to frontend testing, as they test things only backend can see.

### 4. what is the plan for the days before the deadline.

review other members' pull requests, create the markdown file that describes the file structure documentation
